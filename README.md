# Vehicle Management System (VMS)

A console-based Vehicle Management System built in Java that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and separation of concerns.

This project simulates a simple organizational system where different types of vehicles can be added, stored, and viewed along with their details and tax calculations.

---

## Overview

The system allows users to:

- Add different vehicle types (Car, Bike, Truck)
- Store vehicle information in a centralized service
- Display all registered vehicles
- Calculate tax based on vehicle type
- Demonstrate driver assignment capability (structure ready)
- Explore clean OOP architecture

This project is designed as a learning implementation to understand how real systems are structured using layered design.

## Features

- Abstract base class for vehicles
- Type-specific implementations using inheritance
- Engine modeled using composition
- Driver modeled using association
- Service layer to manage data
- Controller layer for user interaction
- Menu-driven console interface
- Polymorphic tax calculation
- Clean separation of responsibilities
